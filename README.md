## Crystal Collector Game

### The Crystal Collector Game is a guessing game where the player needs to guess what combination of crystals will yield a number that matches the target value. The target value and number values for each crystal are generated random numbers which are different for each round but remain constant for a given round. Additionally, the value for each crystal is unique. The graphic below show that when the yellow crystal is clicked on, it adds a value of 10.
